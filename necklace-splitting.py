"""
Two thieves have stolen a valuable necklace consisting of several
different types of jewels. There is an even number of each type of jewel,
and the thieves wish to split each type evenly between them.
The catch is that they must do so by splitting the necklace into some number
of contiguous segments and distributing the segments between the two of them.
However, they want to make as few cuts as possible when splitting the necklace.
Cut the necklace to ensure fairness with the least number of cuts.
Try to solve this problem for N thieves and M types of jewels.

Examples:

```
Thieves: 2
Jewels types: 3
Initial condition: ~⚪~🟡~🔴~🔴~🔴~⚪~🔴~🟡~
Solution: [~⚪~🟡~🔴~🔴~, ~🔴~⚪~🔴~🟡~]
Minimum number of cuts: 1

Thieves: 2
Jewels types: 6
Initial condition: ~💎~⚪~🟡~⚫~🟤~⚫~🟤~🟡~🟤~⚪~🟤~💎~⚪~🔴~⚪~🟤~🟤~🔴~
Solution: [~💎~⚪~🟡~⚫~🟤~, ~⚫~🟤~🟡~🟤~⚪~🟤~💎~⚪~🔴~, ~⚪~🟤~🟤~🔴~]
Minimum number of cuts: 2

Thieves: 3
Jewels types: 5
Initial condition: ~⚪~🔴~💎~⚪~⚪~💎~⚪~🟡~⚪~⚫~⚫~⚪~🟡~🔴~💎~🔴~⚫~🟡~
Solution: [~⚪~🔴~💎~, ~⚪~, ~⚪~💎~⚪~, ~🟡~⚪~⚫~, ~⚫~⚪~🟡~🔴~💎~, ~🔴~⚫~🟡~]
Minimum number of cuts: 5
