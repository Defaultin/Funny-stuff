"""
Two thieves have stolen a valuable necklace consisting of several
different types of jewels. There are an even number of each type of jewel
and the thieves wish to split each jewel type evenly amongst the two of them.
The catch is that they must do so by splitting the necklace into some number
of contiguous segments and distributing the segments between the two of them.
However, they want to make as few cuts as possible when splitting the necklace.
Cut the necklace in a way that ensures fairness with the least number of cuts.
Try to solve this problem for N thieves and M types of jewels.
